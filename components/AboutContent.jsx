        Welcome to QuickCart â€” a personal project
        built to demonstrate my skills in building
        modern, scalable web applications using
        Next.js.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        This demo site showcases seamless
        integration with Clerk for authentication,
        a responsive design with optimized
        performance, and dynamic routing using the
        Next.js framework. From secure user login
        to server-side rendering and
        component-based architecture, QuickCart
        reflects my hands-on experience with
        real-world tech stacks.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        I created this project to further deepen
        my understanding of full-stack development
        and deployment pipelines. If you'd like to
        know more or collaborate on something
        exciting, feel free to reach out!
